# _benchmarking_state-reproducibility

### Authors: Maria Rosaria Nucera, Cal McCrimmon, Davide Vespasiani, Kaan Ã–cal, Trevor Atkeson.

- [x] Testing reproducibility of the pseudotime across the 3 different lines  (FSA0024I1, IST2607K3, WAB0137L8) using genes2genes to align and compare trajectories
- [x] Testing robustness to different criteria for the choice of the root (starting point of differentiation) based on expression of markers for pluripotency/other sets of markers
- [x] Testing what happens when the root starts from cells in a different cell cycle phase (G2M or S)
- [ ] Testing robustness to different number of cells x time point across the lines and whether this affects the trajectory or not
